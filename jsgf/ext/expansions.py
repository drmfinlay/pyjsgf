    Class representing dictation input matching any spoken words.

    This is largely based on the ``Dictation`` element class in the dragonfly Python
    library.

    ``Dictation`` expansions compile to a special reference (``<DICTATION>``),
    similar to :class:`NullRef` and :class:`VoidRef`. See the
    :class:`DictationGrammar` class if you want to use this expansion type with CMU
    Pocket Sphinx.

    The matching implementation for ``Dictation`` expansions will look ahead for
    possible next literals to avoid matching them and making the rule fail to
    match. It will also look backwards for literals in possible future repetitions.

    It will **not** however look at referencing rules for next possible
    literals. If you have match failures because of this, only use ``Dictation``
    expansions in public rules *or* use the ``JointTreeContext`` class before
    matching if you don't mind reducing the matching performance.
